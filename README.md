2. **For new YouTubers**: We provide actionable insights into VTuber affiliations, helping aspiring content creators align with positive, sustainable communities for their journey in the VTubing world.

## **Tools and Techniques**

To bring this analysis to life, we leveraged a powerful suite of tools and technologies across cloud platforms, data engineering, and web development:
